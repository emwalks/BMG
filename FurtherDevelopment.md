## BMG App Further Work & Improvements

- Dependency Inversion for BMG.
- Then if thereâ€™s time inject services into VC rather than having to use the real ones for test? 
- Add an observer to BMG.
- Add coordinators so you're not using storyboards (done). Test these coordinators.
- Add remote backend (e.g. AWS database) to persist data remotely. 
- Add further functions - Winter  alpine climbing and Scottish climbing, integrate maps, USP log ski touring.
- Add a logRockClimbScreenProtocol whose member is a view model with VC as implementation and mock for testing to make it more hexagonal.

## Developer Comments

### MVVM-C Design Pattern & Hexagonal Architeture

- The "View" protocols are only used to link the view models with the appropriate views. 
- There is a view protocol missing for LogRockClimbScreen, as this was the first screen implemented. As this does not have a protocol, this is breaking the ports and adapters architecture principle.

- UI tests were never re-written following introduction of the App Coordinator (ran out of time). Testing could use a hosted app. Testing of coordinator was investigated, see the following repo: 
	- https://github.com/bbc/TDD_Coordinators_TestingAppDelegate

- Other (disregarded) investigations here:
	- https://github.com/bbc/TDD_Coordinators
	- https://github.com/bbc/TDD_Coordinators_Framework

- Using the coordinator did allow removal of storyboard transitions which was nice.

- The database manages and uses a lot of the "model" concerns - separation here could be better. 
- Also the Model type is pssed into the VC in the LogbookViewModel - breaks the MVVM-C separation. 


- The App Coordinator can become a bit of a God class because it does all the gluing together. You could factory out the creation of different types of co-ordinators if your app was big enough to warrant it. 
- See Trivago use of MVVM-C [here](https://tech.trivago.com/post/2016-08-26-mvvmc/).

### General

- Launch arguments were used to clear the database in the UI tests to ensure reproducible db environment.
- Mocks are in the folders of the real implementations. Would probably be better in testing folders.
- N.B. ensure you have switched off toggling to hardware keyboard on the simulator for UI Tests. 
- UI tests mega flakey - e.g. if a small phone is used the submit button may not be on screen.
