## BMG App further work & improvements
	- Dependency Inversion for BMG & teach DI to Jenna
	- Then if thereâ€™s time inject services into VC rather than having to use the real ones for test? 
	- Add an observer to BMG
	- Add coordinators so you're not using storyboards (done)
	- Add remote backend (e.g. AWS database) to persist data remotely. 
	- [ ] Add further functions - Winter  alpine climbing and Scottish climbing, integrate maps, USP log ski touring
	- [ ] Mocks are in the folders of the real implementations
	- [ ] Add a logRockClimbProtocol whose member is a view model with VC as implementation and mock for testing to make it more hexagonal
