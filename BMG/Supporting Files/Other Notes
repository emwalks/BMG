LogRockClimbViewController Notes:

Init toolbar with CGRect to prevent constraints breaking in iOS13 - iOS13 and/or simulator bug

Constraints break when launching keyboard for other textfields in simulator - Also possible iOS13 and/or simulator bug




Other things:


Possibly rename LogRockClimbViewController to RockClimbViewController (Same with ViewModel) so we can reuse it to display past rock climbs? i.e. sometimes you might be logging a new one, sometimes you might be viewing a past one
